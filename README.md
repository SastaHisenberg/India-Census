This project is about Data Analysis of India census 2011. 


It is built with the help of MS SQL, MS Excel and Indian census 2011 website.


I have chosen this project because the data set I want to analyze is already clean and organized


So I just need to do the data analysis part of my project and not data cleaning and extraction.


Skills I have showcased in this project are Basic Arthemitic , SQL 


Firstly i have copied districts data and literacy data from census2011 website into 2 excel sheets


Then I imported excel data sheets into Microsoft SQL


I wrote SQL queries to answer interesting questions about Indian census data from The World Bank
